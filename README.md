## Laboratory work on the course "Programming technology MPI"
  Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing standard designed by a group of researchers
from academia and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures.
  The standard defines the syntax and semantics of a core of library routines useful to a wide range of users writing portable
message-passing programs in C, C ++, and Fortran.
